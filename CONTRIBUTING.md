Contributing can take many forms, and it's not just for developers.

## Ideas

Many of the workbench features were added because the developers thought they
might be useful to others or themselves.

Do you think a feature is missing? Is some step in the workflow hard to accomplish?
Do you want to work on a new/missing STEMFIE component? Let us know.

## Translators

This may be one of the most undervalued type of contribution. FreeCAD and the
STEMFIE Workbench aren't only for people speaking English. Translating different
languages requires the contributions of native speakers worldwide.

The STEMFIE Workbench, like FreeCAD itself, uses the CrowdIn platform
<https://crowdin.com/project/freecad-addons> for management of translations.
Create an account and you'll be able to start contributing right away. In addition
to providing translations, you can also proof read the translations already contributed.
Do a little or a lot. Even small incremental gains are valuable.

Of course, you can do translation locally on your machine, to know more about
the translation process take a look on [the README file](./freecad/stemfie/resources/translations)
on the translations directory.

## Designers

Do our icons make you cringe too? Think you can do better?

As of now we still need 20 icons for commands that use `.png` images.

Here are FreeCAD guidelines for icons: <https://wiki.freecad.org/Artwork_Guidelines>

## Accessibility / Usability

What can be done to improve your experience?
It is easy to overlook an accessibility issue when you're not personally affected
but it's often easy to accommodate once the issue is known.

## Testers

See a bug? Open an issue on GitHub: <https://github.com/bilbaomakers/StemfieWB/issues>

If you have QA experience consider writing test cases.

## Developers

Feel like adding a new feature? Open a ticket to use as a basis for discussion.
Describe your idea. Discuss with the other developers and start coding!
